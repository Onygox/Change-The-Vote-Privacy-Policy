    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> <p>One of my main priorities in developing Change The Vote is visitor privacy. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by this application and how it is used.</p>
                  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
                  <p>For a better experience, while using this application, this application may require you to provide it with certain
                    personally identifiable information, including data from your play experience. The information that is requested will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>
                    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
                    <p> We want to inform you that whenever you use this application, in a case of
                    an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
                    called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
                    device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing the application,
                    the time and date of your use of the application, and other statistics.
                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                  <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
                    memory.
                  </p> <p>This application does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
                    libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
                    either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
                    to refuse cookies, it may restrict your optimal play experience.
                  </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
                  <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p> <ul><li>To facilitate the application;</li> <li>To provide services on its behalf;</li> <li>To perform services related to the application; or</li> <li>To assist me in analyzing how the application is used.</li></ul> <p> I want to inform users that these third parties have access to
                    your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However,
                    they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                  <p> Your trust in providing your Personal Information is immensely valued. Thus I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
                    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, so I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
                  <p>This application may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                    to that site. Although the selection of websites included in this experience was thouroughly vetted, note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
                  </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
                  <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                    under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete it from the server. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal
                    information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                  <p> I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes through application changelogs.
